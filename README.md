# Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker-ETL
Cryptocurrency Price Tracker ETL is a Python-based pipeline that fetches real-time crypto prices (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) from the CoinGecko API, transforms the data (rounding prices, formatting timestamps), and stores it in a MySQL database for analysis or dashboard use.
