# Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker-ETL
Cryptocurrency Price Tracker ETL is a Python-based pipeline that fetches real-time crypto prices (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) from the CoinGecko API, transforms the data (rounding prices, formatting timestamps), and stores it in a MySQL database for analysis or dashboard use.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Cryptocurrency Price Tracker ETL is a lightweight ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built in Python that collects real-time cryptocurrency price data and stores it in a MySQL database for further analysis or dashboard integration.

This project utilizes the CoinGecko API
 to fetch current prices of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, processes the data into a readable format, and loads it into a structured SQL table.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a fully functional ETL pipeline that:

Extracts real-time crypto price data.

Transforms the data for usability.

Loads it into a persistent MySQL database.
